# 🤖 JARVIS - Just A Rather Very Intelligent System

Welcome to Jarvis, an AI that runs my home. 

**Overview:**
Jarvis is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence assistant inspired by the legendary J.A.R.V.I.S. from the Iron Man movies. It's designed to simplify my life by automating tasks, providing information, and enhancing my overall productivity.

## Key Features:
- 🗣️ Voice Commands: Like Tony Stark, I can control JARVIS with voice commands.
- 🏠 Home Automation: Integrates with my smart home devices to control lights, temperature, and more.
- 🎯 Personalized Insights: Get tailored recommendations and insights based on my preferences.
- 📅 Task Automation: Delegate tasks, set reminders, and manage my schedule effortlessly.
- 🧠 Natural Language Processing: Communicate naturally, and Jarvis will understand and respond intelligently.

## 🌳 Branches

- **`prod` Branch**: The primary branch containing the most stable and production-ready version of Jarvis.

- **`dev` Branch**: Where ongoing development and new features are tested. Not production-ready but fun for tech enthusiasts.
